	"home_description": "Hey there, Space Explorer! Welcome aboard the official Astro blog starter kit, your perfect launchpad for a personalized website, blog, or portfolio. The astro.config.mjs file is already pre-configured with some Astro magic, so you're all set to start customizing it with technologies like Tailwind, React, or Vue as you see fit. To begin your journey, you might consider editing the homepage, which you can find in the src/pages/index.astro file. The header of the site is in the src/components/Header.astro file, and you can stamp your identity on the footer by navigating to the src/components/Footer.astro file. We've also included some sample blog posts located in the src/pages/blog/ folder for your perusal. To give your blog posts a unique layout, head over to the src/layouts/BlogPost.astro file. If you ever hit a snag, the Astro documentation and our Discord channel are your go-to resources for troubleshooting. And if you're in the mood for something a bit more stylish, check out the astro-blog-template by Maxi Ferreira.",
